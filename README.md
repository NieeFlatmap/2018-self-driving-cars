# Google Hash Code 2018
Team Niee Flatmap's solution to this year's problem! Our algorithms scores as high as 48 717 910 (~97,5% efficiency) points across all data sets
and places us as the 199th team in Extended Round by the time of writing.

## Q&A
### What is Google Hash Code?
Hash Code is a team programming competition organized by Google. Each team consist of 2-4 people with aim of optimizing an NP-complete
problem withing 4 hours. Hash Code gathers yearly over 10 000 teams competing simultaneously.

### What was the 2018 challenge?
The participants were given a data set containing number of self-driving cars, a rectangular map of the city and preordered rides by the users.
The task was to schedule all the rides in a way that satisfies as many people as possible (with bonus points for coming on time).

### How can I recreate the results?
Unfortunately only participants can measure the scores. To run the solution on a given data set just run "answer.py" in the console after modifying the
data set path.

### What is the algorithm's complexity?
We estimate it to be around O(T\*V\*R), where T how much time do we operate in, V is number of available vehicles and R is number of rides to schedule.
No precise answer though, we are happy it is not exponential :sweat_smile:
